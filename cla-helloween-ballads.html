So, there have been a lot of big albums that have come out in February, and there are gonna be a LOT more. Also, my thoughts have somehow gotten much longer this time around.

Download FLAC Helloween - Ballads 2000 lossless We had one such top for Helloween, let's have one for Stratovarius. My top is: 16) Stratovarius - everything here sounds very underdeveloped and barebones, "60% Stratovarius" as mr. Tolkki himself put it. Really goes to show the state band was in at the moment. 15) Fright Night - not bad but not very catchy/interesting. "Future Shock" is a awesome though and "Goodbye" is a great way to close an album. 14) Revolution Renaissanse demo - actually good if you don't mind Tolkki repeating.

This continued through the rest of the 70's until Japan become a common Asian fixture among big world tours towards the end of the 70's.

Favourite Song: Daydream XI - Painted Smile (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMFE9PL6zHw) This song is everything I could have wanted from Daydream; strongly emotive vocals, lighter use of orchestrations that compliment and emphasises the theatrical feel the song brings (and the whole album), and an awesome technical.

Its first lineup consisted of singer and rhythm guitarist Kai Hansen, bassist Markus Grosskopf. 
Most people know Thin Lizzy from their commercial hit single (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quyB8PMTD3o).

Ahhh Christmas. The best time of the year and the day we all celebrate the birth of Jesus, or at least, we pretend we do.
